quantitive trait loci (QTL) control continuous traits' expression

1 mu = 43kb in neurospora

Ratios
	fruit shape (15:1)
		any dominance causes heart shaped fruit
	coat color in mice (9:4:3)
		C controls the availability of B and A to be expressed
		9 A-C- agouti
		3 A-cc white
		3 aaC- black
		1 aacc white
	summer squash fruit color (12:3:1)
		W acts as inhibitor preventing white->green. Dominant Y causes green->yellow
		9 W-Y- white
		3 W-yy white
		3 wwY- yellow
		1 wwyy green
	duplicate decessive epistasis (9:7)
	dominant (9:3:3:1)
	
	


Bacteria DNA transfer
	1. Conjugation- transfer of plasmid from one cell to another directly
	2. Transformation- extracellular dna exchanges with receipients
	3. transduction- bacteriophages mediate transfer of dna from one cell to anotehr
*transfer is one directional

Donor F+. Receipt F-

Lederburd/Tatum's experiment
strain A had xx--- amino acids (2/5)
strain B had --xxx amino acids (3/5)
plates A, B, and A/B mixture. Needed recombination to survive

1. F plamis needs an orgin and an F-pilus for transfer. 
2. F+ connects with F- cell and use Rolling Circle Replication.
3. DNA stays double stranded for donor and is made into double stranded in receipient 

Hfr (high frequency recombination) strains
	recombination between plasmid and chromosome
	This can cause entire  chromosomes to be replicated using rolling circle into a F- cell


Davis's experiment
U tube + filter + 2 bacteria. Didn't plate. Need cell-to-cell for conjugation

transconjugants

making competent cells
	chemical transformation (cheap, most popular)
		CaCl2 then heat shock 92 centigrade for 30s
		Cl goes into cell causing it to swell and open cellular pores
	electroporation (expensive)
		strong electric pulse makes holes in membrane


SNP, RFLP, STR
